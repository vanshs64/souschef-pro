On a medium flame, fry cashews, almonds and cardamoms in 1 tablespoon ghee or oil, for 2 to 3 mins (read notes 1). Stir in onions, ginger, garlic and green chili if using.
Saute for 5 to 6 mins, deglaze with 3 to 4 tablespoons water and cook further for 3 to 4 mins. Remove the green chili for a low heat option. Cool down and blend with water to a smooth puree/paste.
How to make Shahi Paneer
On a medium flame, heat the rest of the ghee in the pan and add bay leaf, jeera, cinnamon and cloves (if using). When they begin to sizzle, add the puree along with chili powder, garam masala, turmeric and salt.
Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile whisk yogurt in a bowl and add 1 to 2 tbsps of the sautéed paste. Mix well to a smooth mixture.
Reduce the heat to low and incorporate it to the rest of the sautéed paste/sauce in 2 batches, mixing between each addition.
Saute on a medium heat for 3 to 4 mins and pour water. Mix well and cook covered until thick, creamy and traces of fats are visible on top. (takes me about 10 mins, depends on the cookware)
Optionally, remove the whole spices (except jeera) at this stage and taste test to adjust salt. Add the paneer and black pepper for spice/heat or more garam masala for flavor. Cook for a minute and turn off the heat. Stir in the heavy cream if using.
Sprinkle crushed saffron, kewra/ rose water and cover. Rest for a minimum of 5 to 7 minutes.
Shahi Paneer goes well with Saffron rice, Turmeric rice, Jeera rice, plain basmati, roti, naan or plain parathas.
