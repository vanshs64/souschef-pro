Simple Bruschetta204 servings3 fresh tomatoes, ripeA small handful of basil leaves1 teaspoon good-tasting white wine vinegar (or red/balsamic), or to taste1/4 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving3 - 4 sourdough or country-style bread slices (at least 1/2-inch thick)2 cloves garlic, peeledRinse and dry your tomatoes. Halve each of them, use a finger to remove the seeds, and cut out the cores. Roughly cut the tomatoes into 1/2-inch pieces and place in a medium bowl. Tear the basil into small pieces, and add that as well. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, a small splash of vinegar, and a pinch of salt. Gently toss, taste, adjust if necessary, and set aside.
Heat a grill or oven to medium-high. When itâ€™s ready, use the remaining 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to brush across the slices of bread. Grill or bake until well-toasted and golden brown with a hint of char. Flipping when the first side is done. Remove from grilled and when cool enough to handle, rub both sides of each slice of bread with garlic.
Cut each slice of bread in half if you like, and top each segment with the tomato mixture. And a finishing drizzle of olive oil is always nice.
